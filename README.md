# pokeball-hunt

To play Pokeball Hunt, you will need the Processing.py development environment, available from https://processing.org/
Our program is written in Python, so the Python mode for Processing is necessary. I have included all files necessary for the 
game to run. Open the main file, Final_Project.pyde to run the game.
